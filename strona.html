            <div class="text-center"><strong>Scientific Publishing House (SPH)</strong> was established in <strong>2008</strong> by the <strong>Centre of Sociological Research (CSR)</strong>.
            Initially it was created for publishing scientific outcomes of the CSR team. However, in a short time it
            became a platform for scientist from Commonwealth of the Independent States and EU countries. And not just 
            a platform for publishing, referencing, reading and citing their works, CSR team pays a lot of attention to 
            human relations
            and makes everything possible to ensure close interaction of all authors
            and the editorial board for exchange of experience and information.
            We are a small and ambitious publishing house. At the present moment we are focused on publishing scientific
            literature from all fields of Economy and Sociology. We publish scientific books and journals such as
            Economics & Sociology, Journal of International Studies and special editions focused on the cutting-edge topics.
            However, we are open to
            communication and will be happy to bring to life your ideas using our experience and facilities.
